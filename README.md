# BERT-Based LLM Generated Text Detection
This repository contains the implementation of a BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model designed to detect text generated by large language models (LLMs). The model was developed as part of a Kaggle competition, utilizing the provided dataset for training and evaluation.

The code includes the following steps:

Importing necessary libraries from the transformers package and PyTorch.
Loading the train and test datasets from the competition's CSV files.
Preprocessing the text data using the BertTokenizer to prepare it for the BERT model.
Creating a custom Dataset class to handle the tokenized text and corresponding labels.
Initializing the BertForSequenceClassification model with the 'bert-base-uncased' pre-trained weights.
Setting up TrainingArguments and using the Trainer class to train and evaluate the model.
Preprocessing the test dataset and using the trained model to generate predictions.
Converting the model's predictions to binary labels and preparing a submission file.
The repository includes Jupyter notebooks that detail each step of the process, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. The final predictions are saved to a CSV file, ready for submission to the competition.

This model serves as a reference for anyone interested in using BERT for text classification tasks, particularly in the context of detecting machine-generated text. The code is well-documented and can be easily adapted for similar problems.

To run the code, ensure you have the required packages installed as listed in requirements.txt. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

lol detect the readme is wheather ai generatedüòÅ,Happy detecting!
